  description: Human intelligence shines in how we think, not just the outcomes we produce. Al often focuses on "what" (e.g., correct answers), but human-like Al requires understanding the "how" (e.g., reasoning, context). This talk explores a path toward Al that processes language more like humans, focusing on reasoning, figurative language, and modularity. By shifting from "what" to "how," we aim to bridge the gap between Al interpretation and human cognition.

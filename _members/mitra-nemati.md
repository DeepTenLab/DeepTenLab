I earned my master’s in computer science from Tarbiat Modares University in June 2024, focusing on analysis of brain data using graph neural networks. Currently, I am a researcher at DeepTen lab, where I utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct brain functional connectivity graphs from EEG and fMRI data for various tasks such as detecting brain disorders and gender classification. My work enhances traditional methods with machine learning to improve functional brain network accuracy. I’m currently involved in several projects including EEG emotion recognition, EEG imagined speech analysis, and constructing brain functional networks from resting-state fMRI data to study gender differences.

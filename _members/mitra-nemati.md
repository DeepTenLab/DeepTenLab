I am a researcher focused on analyzing graph data using Graph Neural Networks.  My primary interest lies in leveraging graph neural networks to analyze human brain signals (EEG or fMRI), with the goal of constructing brain functional connectivity graphs. This approach allows me to tackle various tasks, such as classifying gender and identifying brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease and autism. 

In my work, I emphasize the importance of constructing accurate brain functional networks. While many studies rely on traditional measures to assess the similarity between brain nodes, I aim to enhance these methods through advanced machine learning techniques. My passion for this field drives me to explore the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, continually seeking to uncover new patterns and insights from complex brain data.
I am currently engaged in several exciting projects, including:

 - **EEG Emotion Recognition:** Utilizing graph neural networks to identify and classify emotional states from EEG data.
 - **Analysis of EEG Imagined Speech:** Implementing graph transformer networks to analyze datasets related to imagined speech from EEG recordings.
 - **Constructing Brain Functional Networks:** Constructing brain functional networks based on resting-state fMRI signals to explore differences related to gender.

I earned my master’s in computer science from Tarbiat Modares University in June 2024, focusing on analysis of brain data using graph neural networks. Currently, I am a researcher at DeepTen lab, where I utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct brain functional connectivity graphs from EEG and fMRI data for various tasks such as detecting brain disorders and gender classification. My work enhances traditional methods with machine learning to improve functional brain network accuracy. I’m currently involved in several projects including EEG emotion recognition, EEG imagined speech analysis, and constructing brain functional networks from resting-state fMRI data to study gender differences.

I am a researcher focused on analyzing graph data using Graph Neural Networks.  My primary interest lies in leveraging graph neural networks to analyze human brain signals (EEG or fMRI), with the goal of constructing brain functional connectivity graphs. This approach allows me to tackle various tasks, such as classifying gender and identifying brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease and autism. 

In my work, I emphasize the importance of constructing accurate brain functional networks. While many studies rely on traditional measures to assess the similarity between brain nodes, I aim to enhance these methods through advanced machine learning techniques. My passion for this field drives me to explore the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, continually seeking to uncover new patterns and insights from complex brain data.
I am currently engaged in several exciting projects, including:

 - **EEG Emotion Recognition:** Utilizing graph neural networks to identify and classify emotional states from EEG data.
 - **Analysis of EEG Imagined Speech:** Implementing graph transformer networks to analyze datasets related to imagined speech from EEG recordings.
 - **Constructing Brain Functional Networks:** Constructing brain functional networks based on resting-state fMRI signals to explore differences related to gender.

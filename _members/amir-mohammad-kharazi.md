Hi, I am Amir Mohammad. I began my academic career in computer science in 2017 at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I then pursued my studies at the master's level in 2021 at Tarbiat Modares University (TMU). My research primarily focuses on computer vision, transformers, and tensor methods, and I have hands-on experience with various vision transformer techniques. As part of the DeepTenLab, I am responsible for maintaining this website, and along with other members, we work with state-of-the-art models to improve the adaptability of computer vision to new problems. I have been a part-time teaching assistant (TA) at AUT, TMU, and Neuromatch Academy (NMA). My hobbies include playing video games and reading manga every now and then.

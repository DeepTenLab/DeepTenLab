I am Amir Mohammad. I began my master's studies in computer science in 2021 at Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), following my undergraduate education at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). My master's thesis focuses on computer vision, transformers, and tensor methods. During my MSc, we successfully designed lightweight vision transformers that achieve significant parameter compression while maintaining better accuracy compared to standard ViTs. As part of the DeepTenLab, we work with state-of-the-art models to enhance the adaptability of computer vision to new challenges.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science, Tarbiat Modares University, under the supervision of Dr. Mansouri Rezghi. My research background is in numerical linear algebra and matrix computations, specifically in the development and implementation of iterative algorithms for solving linear systems arising from image reconstruction problems. Currently, I am focused on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods and their applications in learning tasks. NMF has become a key tool in data mining and machine learning, garnering increasing attention from researchers over the past two decades. This method has been widely and successfully applied in many fields, including data mining, clustering, computer vision, signal processing, community identification, social media analysis, and several others. Research in the deep version of NMF, which is a type of deep latent factor model, is also one of my favorite fields.

Mansoor Rezghi is the associate professor of computer science at Tarbiat  Modres university, Tehran-Iran. He is working on computational and modeling aspects of data science, machine learning. He got my MSc in 2003 from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran-Iran. 

In this period he was interested to work on matrix computation techniques for large scale sparse linear systems. His MSc thesis was
to solve large linear systems by Krylov subspace methods and he succeeded to present a new
preconditioning method for large scale sparse matrices. In PhD, he switched to the inverse problem
and became interested in working on solving large scale linear inverse problems. 

It was the bridge that took him to the image processing techniques and worked on different aspects of image processing like image
de-noising, restoration, and segmentation. In this case, his research was focused on regularization
and structured large scale linear systems that could occur in image restoration problems. In Ph.D.
when he was researching visitor at Linkoping University and worked with Prof. L Elden he became
familiar with data mining and also the application of tensor decomposition in data mining. 

During his Ph.D. and after Ph.D. he was familiar with machine learning and data mining and found that his
techniques and studies in M.sc and Ph.D. (like regularization, sparse representation) are related to
these areas. Therefore, since 2008, he has been active in the field of learning and studied matrix
and tensor modeling in machine learning. Since 2012 that he joined the department of computer
science at Tarbiat Modares University and became active in the mentioned research interests. Recently he became
interested in investigating using multilinear methods in deep learning (especially in CNN networks)
to speed up the learning and big data (incremental tensor decompositions).

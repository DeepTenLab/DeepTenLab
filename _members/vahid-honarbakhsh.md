I'm Vahid, and I hold a PhD in Geophysics with a specialization in Exploration Seismology. For my master's thesis, I applied compressed sensing techniques to recover the location and focal mechanisms of microseismic events. During my doctoral studies, I focused on Full Wave Inversion (FWI) to determine velocity models using deep learning methodologies. Currently, my research is centered on generative model unsupervised learning for inverse problems especially in FWI, a project I refer to as GULIP.

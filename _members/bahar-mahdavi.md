Hi there, I'm Bahar Mahdavi, and I'm thrilled to be part of the TMUDeepTen Laboratory, a leading research group in Computer Science dedicated to advancing the field through innovative computational approaches. I'm excited to contribute to our ongoing research projects while collaborating with my talented colleagues.

I hold an M.Sc. in Molecular Cell Biology with a focus on Genetic engineering from Royan Research Institute, where I gained a well-versed of the intricacies of molecular biology. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Mining at Tarbiat Modares University, which has equipped me with the technical expertise needed to tackle complex bioinformatics challenges.

With a strong foundation in genomic bioinformatics, structural bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, biostatistics, and data analytics, I am passionate about using computational methods to solve real-world biological problems. I'm always open to connect with fellow researchers and collaborate on exciting new projects

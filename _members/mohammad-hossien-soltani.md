I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and its Applications from the International University of Science and Technology, which I completed in February 2022. Subsequently, I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Mining from Tarbiat Modares University, graduating in February 2025. My primary research focus is on adversarial attacks in image data, where I explore advanced methodologies to enhance the robustness and security of machine learning models. Additionally, I have a strong interest in signal and text analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical implementations. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed extensive expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis. I am passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of mathematics and computer science and am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in these fields.

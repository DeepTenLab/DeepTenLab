I am Mohammad Badzohreh, a Master's student in Data Mining at Tarbiat Modares University. My thesis focuses on Vision Transformers, and I have a solid understanding of these models and their applications.
I began my web development journey in 2017, starting with front-end development and later transitioning to back-end programming. Over the years, I gained hands-on experience by working as a freelance web developer for two years.

I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran.
